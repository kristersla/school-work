        "text": "I have to disagree with your glowing assessment of this printer.\nIn my experience, the Ender-3 S1 is not a 3D printer I would recommend to anyone. Here are some of my reasons for that:\n1. I don't believe the Ender-3 S1 motherboard's enclosure provides sufficient cooling for its electronics. My S1 board's early failure supports that statement.\n2. Very soon after I began using the S1, its hotend began oozing melted filament from the heat break's connection to the heater block. This ooze began flowing down the sides of the block and dripping onto my prints. Creality3D required me to send photos of this mess, and not until I sent those did Creality3D finally agree to send a replacement hotend assembly. \n3. Unlike earlier Ender 3 printers, the S1 frame's extrusions are not slotted for T-Nuts. This means you can't easily replace the printer's v-wheel motion system with steel linear rails. So, you're stuck with plastic guide wheels which will continually wear, resulting in gradual print quality loss and the need for periodic wheel replacement.\n4. These deficiencies are sufficient to support my personal decision against further Ender-3 S1 purchases. However, a far greater problem looms above these, which is my experience with \"the Monster,\" (my term for Creality3D's customer service). When my S1's motherboard failed, months of negotiations were required before the Monster agreed to send a new motherboard. However, this was sent by slow freight, and week after week passed before it finally arrived. Then to add further insult to injury, this new board was also defective, and nothing - no attempt to install a new boot loader, and no attempt to install new firmware could fix this board. Once again, this forced me to deal with the \"Monster\" And once again, more back and forth emails and months of wasted time passed before Creality finally agreed to replace their bad replacement board. And I still don't have that new board. So here I am many months later, and my Ender-3 S1 still doesn't work. So, forgive me if I don't like your video and your glowing evaluation of Creality3D's Ender-3 S1 printer.",

I've run it for about 80 hours continuously now and the only adhesion issues I had were while tuning it Initially. I've found that the cr touch is kinda unreliable as you'll find yourself having to mess with the z offset every time you try to use auto level. Though not just with this printer specifically, I've found myself not setting offset with paper but just by eye. I also turn the knobs and guage the nozzle gap by eye as well. I don't recommend doing this if you don't have a calibrated eye. You'll know when you get one, takes alot of experience in metrology.",
