Here I go:\n\nWhat is it with koreans and big booba?\nI don't mean to say, that this was an explicit factor for korean people.\n\nBut I noticed, that korean artworks are more explicit about ideal representations, so it might be all-that, only.\n\nI'm just sooo fed up with that absolute display of a correct majority or quasi-orthographical approach of the korean culture.\nIt shows little regret in \"apparently unending excess\", imo.\n\nI can simply already picture the resulting conceit of \"having to be correct/normal\" and the painfully fatal resolutions made by applying all that without visible regrets.\n\nI have never been to Korea, so I might simply have a bad source for my references here, as well.\nWhat's Your take on that?",
