You already were one of my favourite fragrance YouTubers before your break but since your comeback you've had a certain attitude about you that makes me like you even better. Sticking it to the snobs, trolls and BS Fragrantica reviewers who, judging by the contents of their reviews clearly don't even own the fragrance! And now you're also bringing a more proletarian approach to fragrance collecting (which is very timely) but with the same standards and production quality, going back to the roots/basics of what this hobby is all about: smelling good! Somewhere down the road, this community went from a bunch of guys and galls sharing their passion for juice that smells good and helping each other navigate the ocean of fragrances to find what they like without having to buy all of them to people flexing about how much they've spent and cringe worthy external validation seeking compliment hunters. This change happened around 2016 I'd say, right when a certain other content creator you mentioned in this video blew up and made the Fragcom more mainstream. Oh well, the juice is still what it's all about for me so I don't give a hoot anyway ü§£",
