All sizes are beautiful and while I personally tend to find larger voluptuous woman very with very large breasts very beautiful its not the norm, from my experience the vast majority of guys actually prefer fairly small to average bust sizes, they often fantasize about slightly large sizes or might find them sexy but not actually prefer them or find them attractive which is kinda sad so I'm surprised the one guy said he liked the girl with G's since most guys would probably be to embarrassed to admit they liked them in public. so the lady with Cs in the video is more the ideal size with maybe slightly wider hips and a fuller butt would maybe be closer to the average global preference.",
