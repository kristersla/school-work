Accessing extruders, nozzle, and so on is hard, takes time and replace the whole kit as a quick alternative will cost you at least $100. If I compare this machine and an original CR10 for intensive budget printing, I'd choose 100 times the original CR10. I have 2,  after more than 5 years I just replaced the extruder kit and updated the bed. I know, the CR10 is ugly, bulky, and looks cheap but it's just reliable, with great quality and it's easy to fix. Once you level this thing you won't need to do it again. The S1 is a great design probably the best, in my opinion for light use but if you need printing large quantities, long term, this isn't the machine. If you still want to it because, I'll recommend paying for the insurance so you can replace it. I've replaced two of them already after 4 months of work and probably I'll need to replace another two this week. I have other machines industry grade, more expensive ($.1.2K) and the one that has given me the less problems is that cheap CR10 ü§î.",

I've had to take everything apart and clean it! (Not good on a printer less than a month old!) Hopefully this is a one off.

        "text": "Yes, the sprite direct drive extruder and the dual z is a step in the right direction. However, you would think by now creality could have gone with touch screen for that price range, rather than fiddling with a stupid little knob. \n\nBut I would hesitate to that you don't need to be tech savvy as much as with other enders.. Let's face it, yeah, 3d printers have come a long way, but they are still in their infancy and certainly not maintenance free like 2d printers - users still have to be technical minded or at least ready for the learning curve .\n\nAlso, I personally feel the more upgrades done to a 3d printer (direct drive being a big example) the more tuned your settings have to be. Not a great playground for someone new..\n\nI have 2x ender 3 Pro's that can be found under $100, leaving you with $350 for upgrading once you have started getting used to 3d printers. Most of these upgrades can be bought for this over time and at a slightly shallower learning curve..\n\nFinal analysis: if I was to recommend to someone new, I would recommend the 3 Pro or v2 if they have extra cash.\n\nNice try to creality and well done, but it's not perfect yet..",

        "text": "The Fan sucking up filament is a concern, however, the 'heat' being pushed through is not. ( I personally don't think) The reason why is, your printing at 200ish.  Your bed at 100ish isn't going to have 100ish air above it  (thermal capacities, dissipation, etc) and once you begin to circulate air, your mixing the 'hot' with 'cool'  - the biggest thing is - the 'hot' air from the bed, is still COLD air compared to the printing temp, by about 100C if not more.    It's like if your room heater kicks on pumping out 27C heat to keep the room warm, this is COLD compared to the print temps and bed temps, so if you have ABS going - your probably going to warp thanks to that draft - even though, it's 27C \"Heat\"      What happens on the S1 is similar, your pumping out 100C \"heat\" being pumped into the fan to \"cool\" the 200C printing parts, which, doesn't matter, it's still colder than the print temp, so it is 'cold'.   Even 'hot air' inside a PC helps keep other parts of the PC 'cool' by keeping the air flowing, it's when the air stagnates and can't move fast enough, and only heats up, that things 'overheat' in a PC.\n\nAll that being said, I don't like the 'intake' being on the print side where wisps can be sucked into the fan, even if it doesn't hurt the print, eventually it's gonna clog that fan up.\n\nAlso the price.  the S1 is just.. not a friendly price range.  It's a new concept of an old design, but still lacks some features that would be considered standard at that price range.  The 500 to 600 dollar range should be basically the most reliable work horses ever, and the bed and a few other kinks are keeping the S1 from being that work horse.  It's like a Prusa price, but without the Prusa reliability- which honestly is the only reason Prusa can be argued to be worth the price range (as the print quality is not drastically better than a stock ender 3 from 2019, but the reliability is years ahead of the ender 3)\n\nIf it were $100 cheaper, I'd say go for it, it's not a \"workhorse' but your definately getting what your paying for (and you'll probably spend a little on , better beds, etc)   \n\nI just can't see the value in a PTFE lined Direct Drive system being more expensive than a non-PTFE lined (all metal) system being cheaper, no matter the gimmicky add ons.  (almost all of which are basic improvements considered by the community, like dual Z)\n\nAlso 2208's are nice and all, but most are suggesting 2209's in 2022, so they are using a still 'older' driver set and not quite pumping out what most \"new\" printers are pushing. (like Vorons, Ratrigs, SkTank, etc.)  even though most are also moving to 'coreXY design\" as the next ting, a good set of 2209's can go a long way.  IF the price included 2209's I could say it was close to price range, the biggest issue then only being the PTFE lined hotend -  which 100% should be all metal, and the minor problem of the fan angle.\n\nIt's nice to see Creality listening to community, making changes, and trying to do better - but they seem to be skipping some of the biggest things desired (all metal hot end) in order for more profits in the long run. I would have rather liked to see this version of the Ender3 delayed 6 months or even a year, make all metal hotends stock, and change that bed out for the price they are asking, the 'fan position' would be a tiny TINY concern then, as the 'value for what I paid\" would be tremendous. (assuming they didn't bump up the price)  they are working on an all metal hotend anyway for the S1 - to be sold seperately, and I feel this will be like the glass bed the Ender 3 had, where \"some\" will come with it, and some won't depending on how old of a model you purchased.",

I did have an issue with the z offset that resulted in the stock bed taking some damage while trying to tune for petg.  I've since replaced it with a rough and smooth pei flex sheet and both of those are working well.  Note: features like pressure advance were disabled in the firmware and to avoid the constant back and forth of updating firmware, I switched it over to Klipper.  Since the S1 is so new there were few resources to help with this, but it was worth the effort.  It did highlight one issue, and this just might be my S1, but the USB-C connection drops sometimes.   I've tried different raspberry pi's and different cables and the only time i have an issue with any of them is on the S1.  I've never lost a print because of this, but sometimes it can take a few minutes to get it up and running.   My plan is to replace the controller board with a BTT Pico if it gets any worse.  Also, for taller prints, the nozzle would start hitting the previous layers.  I ended up loosening up the vertical supports, clamping them in place with a couple squares, re-tightening things, and that appears to have taken care of it.",
