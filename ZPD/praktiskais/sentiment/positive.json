So it's false advertising calling a \"gaming\" headset in where microphones are very much needed in voice chatting other players or for commentary.\r\n\r\n6/10 for me. Pretty disappointed to be honest.\r\n\r\nAt least the sound quality is pretty decent. And the volume scroll wheel feature is pretty neat.",
