(except to say because it was their first fragrance, or because it's cheap.) they should all be telling us why one fragrance is better than the other, whether for the office, gym, clubbing, etc. any random tiktokker can make a loop that lists their favorites. i would recommend that you not give positive exposure to such content-free media.",
