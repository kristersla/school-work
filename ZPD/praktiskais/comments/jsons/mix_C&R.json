        "text": "i have to disagree with your glowing assessment of this printer.\nin my experience, the ender-3 s1 is not a 3d printer i would recommend to anyone. here are some of my reasons for that:\n1. i don't believe the ender-3 s1 motherboard's enclosure provides sufficient cooling for its electronics. my s1 board's early failure supports that statement.\n2. very soon after i began using the s1, its hotend began oozing melted filament from the heat break's connection to the heater block. this ooze began flowing down the sides of the block and dripping onto my prints. creality3d required me to send photos of this mess, and not until i sent those did creality3d finally agree to send a replacement hotend assembly.\n3. unlike earlier ender 3 printers, the s1 frame's extrusions are not slotted for t-nuts. this means you can't easily replace the printer's v-wheel motion system with steel linear rails. so, you're stuck with plastic guide wheels which will continually wear, resulting in gradual print quality loss and the need for periodic wheel replacement.\n4. these deficiencies are sufficient to support my personal decision against further ender-3 s1 purchases. however, a far greater problem looms above these, which is my experience with \"the monster,\" (my term for creality3d's customer service). when my s1's motherboard failed, months of negotiations were required before the monster agreed to send a new motherboard. however, this was sent by slow freight, and week after week passed before it finally arrived. then to add further insult to injury, this new board was also defective, and nothing - no attempt to install a new boot loader, and no attempt to install new firmware could fix this board. once again, this forced me to deal with the \"monster\" and once again, more back and forth emails and months of wasted time passed before creality finally agreed to replace their bad replacement board. and i still don't have that new board. so here i am many months later, and my ender-3 s1 still doesn't work. so, forgive me if i don't like your video and your glowing evaluation of creality3d's ender-3 s1 printer."

    },
    {
        "text": "the fan sucking up filament is a concern, however, the 'heat' being pushed through is not. ( i personally don't think) the reason why is, your printing at 200ish. your bed at 100ish isn't going to have 100ish air above it (thermal capacities, dissipation, etc) and once you begin to circulate air, your mixing the 'hot' with 'cool' - the biggest thing is - the 'hot' air from the bed, is still cold air compared to the printing temp, by about 100c if not more. it's like if your room heater kicks on pumping out 27c heat to keep the room warm, this is cold compared to the print temps and bed temps, so if you have abs going - your probably going to warp thanks to that draft - even though, it's 27c \"heat\" what happens on the s1 is similar, your pumping out 100c \"heat\" being pumped into the fan to \"cool\" the 200c printing parts, which, doesn't matter, it's still colder than the print temp, so it is 'cold'. even 'hot air' inside a pc helps keep other parts of the pc 'cool' by keeping the air flowing, it's when the air stagnates and can't move fast enough, and only heats up, that things 'overheat' in a pc.\nall that being said, i don't like the 'intake' being on the print side where wisps can be sucked into the fan, even if it doesn't hurt the print, eventually it's gonna clog that fan up.\nalso the price. the s1 is just.. not a friendly price range. it's a new concept of an old design, but still lacks some features that would be considered standard at that price range. the 500 to 600 dollar range should be basically the most reliable work horses ever, and the bed and a few other kinks are keeping the s1 from being that work horse. it's like a prusa price, but without the prusa reliability- which honestly is the only reason prusa can be argued to be worth the price range (as the print quality is not drastically better than a stock ender 3 from 2019, but the reliability is years ahead of the ender 3)\nif it were $100 cheaper, i'd say go for it, it's not a \"workhorse' but your definately getting what your paying for (and you'll probably spend a little on , better beds, etc)\ni just can't see the value in a ptfe lined direct drive system being more expensive than a non-ptfe lined (all metal) system being cheaper, no matter the gimmicky add ons. (almost all of which are basic improvements considered by the community, like dual z)\nalso 2208's are nice and all, but most are suggesting 2209's in 2022, so they are using a still 'older' driver set and not quite pumping out what most \"new\" printers are pushing. (like vorons, ratrigs, sktank, etc.) even though most are also moving to 'corexy design\" as the next ting, a good set of 2209's can go a long way. if the price included 2209's i could say it was close to price range, the biggest issue then only being the ptfe lined hotend - which 100% should be all metal, and the minor problem of the fan angle.\nit's nice to see creality listening to community, making changes, and trying to do better - but they seem to be skipping some of the biggest things desired (all metal hot end) in order for more profits in the long run. i would have rather liked to see this version of the ender3 delayed 6 months or even a year, make all metal hotends stock, and change that bed out for the price they are asking, the 'fan position' would be a tiny tiny concern then, as the 'value for what i paid\" would be tremendous. (assuming they didn't bump up the price) they are working on an all metal hotend anyway for the s1 - to be sold seperately, and i feel this will be like the glass bed the ender 3 had, where \"some\" will come with it, and some won't depending on how old of a model you purchased."
