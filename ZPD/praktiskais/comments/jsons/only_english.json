(even i'm being test focused now)\ni am interested that you failed for using your indicator on a busy road. if this is not allowed, how on earth can you move off from the side of the road at very busy times?\nthere is nothing wrong with using a \"begging signal\" if used correctly. i've never had anyone fail for this, learners or instructors!\nthank you again for the content and keep it up."

(sorry for the long comment ) interesting video as always. good to keep the old knowledge fresh!"
