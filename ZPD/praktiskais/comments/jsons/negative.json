        "text": "the reason why non-native speakers may have a different accent when speaking a foreign language, even when fluent, is due to differences in sound, stress and rhythm between languages. the sounds of letters differ between languages and learning about letters individually does not provide an understanding of how they work together. for example, certain consonant combinations may be forbidden in a native language, so people may insert sounds to make them pronounceable in a foreign language. additionally, stress patterns in languages vary, with french words being stressed on the final syllable, whereas english words often have a secondary stress in addition to the primary one. finally, the rhythm of a language can be syllable-timed or stress-timed, with cantonese and italian being syllable-timed and english being stress-timed. these differences can make it difficult for non-native speakers to adjust their pronunciation, stress and rhythm to fit the rules of the foreign language."
