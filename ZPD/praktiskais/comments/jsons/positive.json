        "text": "the short answer? because you're not pronouncing words properly.\nan 'accent' is simply a particular way words are pronounced. when someone normally speaks another language and is learning a completely different one... they'll have an accent, but only if they don't learn how letters and words are pronounced in the language.\na basic example is someone that speaks english, trying to talk in spanish.\nif someone that speaks english was ignorant to spanish pronunciation, they'd say 'hola' as the letter o (as pronounced in english, not spanish), then -la. more like 'oh-luh'. this is an accent, whether american, british, australian, canadian or kiwi. it's still an accent and in short, is the butchering of a language.\nwhen one learns a language and bothers to learn actual pronunciation, they should ultimately sound exactly like a native speaker, no one would know.\nin this case, it would be achieved simply by pronouncing 'hola' the way it would be in spanish. a spanish 'o' sound (silent h as they're not pronounced in spanish), then -luh.\nthere. no more 'accent' other than a spanish speaking one.\nwhen learning other languages, we have the benefit of getting to choose the accent we want in that language, because we weren't raised into one. this is why training an accent in another language is much easier than training another one within a language."

(nespor, 2014). the reason why english speakers notice that syllabic homorhythm is, in my opinion, due to two main causes : 1) the fact that the stereotype of the italian accent is actually drawn from neapolitan, 2) the fact that an italian locutor has a tendency not to distinguish long and short vowels in english because simply from the point of view of the italian source phonology, english words almost never present that structure that triggers vowel elongation in italian instead. rather, english words invite, if anything, an italian to double the consonant and/or add a final schewa. none of this, however, implies that italian always has syllables of equal length, for such is only a foreign ear's impression of the italian language."
