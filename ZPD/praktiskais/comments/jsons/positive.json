        "text": "ya flat earth people are like the scientology religious cult i have studied things on my own from religion to flat earth and they don't make any damn sense lol at all you're telling me that the only planet out there is flat is earth in the rest of them around in the moon is round the sun is round and yes eventually the sky is going to change again because of the position of the galaxy and within the next few thousand years this guy is going to start looking different anyway and that so far ha been yet to be proved. but yeah you need all kinds of scientific research to be done and none of it on the flat earth since the dawn of all this discussion but yes the earth is round now it's not a complete round sphere because if you take out the ocean waters the earth itself is slightly deformed and is kind of like a pear shape but the bulge in the earth has been proven that's why we have rogue waves the earth does rotate. do they have done studies and shown studies of the difference between flat earth and around earth and when you look at everything with how it would work the flat earth does not work on the scale that the spherical earth does . they've even made computer simulations and did mathematical equations on flat earth and round earth and everything points in the direction that the earth is round and not flat and that's ai doing the equations for both so if putting in all the information that flat earthers talk about and the round earthers talk about it a computer comes up with the same thing that the earth is round well that's saying something.\ni mean i don't trust our government but they have proof that the moon landing happened they have pictures of the landing site from other countries that have gone to the moon and the moon is round everything else is round they have found some flat asteroids however a lot of them don't have night and day it's mostly day maybe slightly twilight but for the most part it's constantly day on one side and then the other flat part is dark. and then in a flat earth scenario if it's the way that they say it is the entire earth would be covered in daylight on a spherical side of it you would have parts of the earth that are twilight to near dark to sometimes in certain parts of the year would be day and night in some parts would be completely night for a certain amount of time and complete day well that's what we have. the reason that they don't want you to go all the way through antarctica is because they don't want anybody fighting and causing a war and trying to have a stronghold in antarctica due to the fact of all the resources that antarctica does have they have found oil they have found gold they have found diamonds they've done a lot of lasering and death search there's lakes there's a mountain terrains there's valleys when the ice melts when it warms up the continent would be completely exposed and the governments around the world that have gone to antarctica have made the pact to where they want to just keep it for research and keep it a safe haven well now why would they want to keep it a safe haven because with all those resources that we have that would mean that there's more oil than the middle east there's more gold silver copper and they're the mining would be absolutely insane well we already have enough of all that and they don't want to disrupt that not only that it would also bring the value of all that stuff down because there's a higher abundance which would mean that the prices could go down and people would not be making as much money that is the truth about why antarctica is like that so that's good that people want to believe that the earth is flat and yada yada yada. but it takes away from the fact that if antarctica was exposed for what it has and already they're controlling all the diamonds flows because we have such an abundance it would drop the value of the diamonds completely now with what they found in arctica if that all got exposed everything would just be devalued. could you imagine gold only costing or maybe like two to three instead of having a gold bar that would be a couple million dollars. and not only that the military at least the navy they run operations underneath the ice in antarctica due to the fact of the stuff that happened during world war ii the germans were working on something and we're trying to hide that and where people forget is that for some reason germany was trying to do something in antarctica and now people are trying to cover that up. due to the fact that would change the world economy has nothing to do with a flat earth. you can just trust the government all you want but the fact is that everybody in the damn world that has gone up above 40,000 ft has seen the curvature of the earth and i know damn well that the earth is round because myself i have been in an aircraft that was well over 60,000 ft and you definitely can tell that the earth is round . i personally think that when people start doing more of these missions and civilians more and more go up to space they can see it for themselves william shatner went up there and he even said hey there is this round i think seeing is believing and i think that the more people actually go out there and realize what's out there they would have a better understanding as far as they're being an ice shelf around the planet and no ship sail around the world and ships when they go off course they run into some of the worst cities that they've ever seen ever due to the fact of the curvature of the earth and due to the fact that there are rogue waves that are giant and and we wouldn't have that if the earth was flat. yes there are passageways that would make the appearance of the illusion to a flat earth but the fact of it is that you can sail around the world it's just not as safe and the waters are rough. now why would they be so rough if the earth was flat. i have many members of my family that have sailed and that have been out in the ocean and it is no joke out there i would love to go see all the oceans by if i did it i would want a very strong strong strong strong boat and i want a boat that's able to go through some vicious waves because you can't take a lot of ships and not have rough experiences. and i can't imagine being on a boat no storm clouds in the sky at all and experiencing some of the roughest waters that you could ever have when you're going over the curvature of the earth are they think it's all fun and it would be smooth and going over there but as the water of the earth is rotating and doing things in your sailing over the curvature it's an interesting experience. and i know of four different family members that have personally seen and been through rouge waves. and to me the rogue wave is the biggest giveaway that the earth is round and is spinning. i know from what i understand about the flat earth and all that our oceans would be a lot different."
