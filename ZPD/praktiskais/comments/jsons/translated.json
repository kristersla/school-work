        "text": "the fan sucking up filament is a concern, however, the 'heat' being pushed through is not. ( i personally don't think) the reason why is, your printing at 200ish. your bed at 100ish isn't going to have 100ish air above it (thermal capacities, dissipation, etc) and once you begin to circulate air, your mixing the 'hot' with 'cool' - the biggest thing is - the 'hot' air from the bed, is still cold air compared to the printing temp, by about 100c if not more. it's like if your room heater kicks on pumping out 27c heat to keep the room warm, this is cold compared to the print temps and bed temps, so if you have abs going - your probably going to warp thanks to that draft - even though, it's 27c \"heat\" what happens on the s1 is similar, your pumping out 100c \"heat\" being pumped into the fan to \"cool\" the 200c printing parts, which, doesn't matter, it's still colder than the print temp, so it is 'cold'. even 'hot air' inside a pc helps keep other parts of the pc 'cool' by keeping the air flowing, it's when the air stagnates and can't move fast enough, and only heats up, that things 'overheat' in a pc.\nall that being said, i don't like the 'intake' being on the print side where wisps can be sucked into the fan, even if it doesn't hurt the print, eventually it's gonna clog that fan up.\nalso the price. the s1 is just.. not a friendly price range. it's a new concept of an old design, but still lacks some features that would be considered standard at that price range. the 500 to 600 dollar range should be basically the most reliable work horses ever, and the bed and a few other kinks are keeping the s1 from being that work horse. it's like a prusa price, but without the prusa reliability- which honestly is the only reason prusa can be argued to be worth the price range (as the print quality is not drastically better than a stock ender 3 from 2019, but the reliability is years ahead of the ender 3)\nif it were $100 cheaper, i'd say go for it, it's not a \"workhorse' but your definately getting what your paying for (and you'll probably spend a little on , better beds, etc)\ni just can't see the value in a ptfe lined direct drive system being more expensive than a non-ptfe lined (all metal) system being cheaper, no matter the gimmicky add ons. (almost all of which are basic improvements considered by the community, like dual z)\nalso 2208's are nice and all, but most are suggesting 2209's in 2022, so they are using a still 'older' driver set and not quite pumping out what most \"new\" printers are pushing. (like vorons, ratrigs, sktank, etc.) even though most are also moving to 'corexy design\" as the next ting, a good set of 2209's can go a long way. if the price included 2209's i could say it was close to price range, the biggest issue then only being the ptfe lined hotend - which 100% should be all metal, and the minor problem of the fan angle.\nit's nice to see creality listening to community, making changes, and trying to do better - but they seem to be skipping some of the biggest things desired (all metal hot end) in order for more profits in the long run. i would have rather liked to see this version of the ender3 delayed 6 months or even a year, make all metal hotends stock, and change that bed out for the price they are asking, the 'fan position' would be a tiny tiny concern then, as the 'value for what i paid\" would be tremendous. (assuming they didn't bump up the price) they are working on an all metal hotend anyway for the s1 - to be sold seperately, and i feel this will be like the glass bed the ender 3 had, where \"some\" will come with it, and some won't depending on how old of a model you purchased.",
