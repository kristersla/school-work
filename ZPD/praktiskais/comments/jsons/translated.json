(nespor, 2014). the reason why english speakers notice that syllabic homorhythm is, in my opinion, due to two main causes : 1) the fact that the stereotype of the italian accent is actually drawn from neapolitan, 2) the fact that an italian locutor has a tendency not to distinguish long and short vowels in english because simply from the point of view of the italian source phonology, english words almost never present that structure that triggers vowel elongation in italian instead. rather, english words invite, if anything, an italian to double the consonant and/or add a final schewa. none of this, however, implies that italian always has syllables of equal length, for such is only a foreign ear's impression of the italian language."
