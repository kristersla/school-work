Practical effects, real costumes and makeup instead of green suit, weird camera perspectives to make the hobbits smaller instead doing it in post (highly recommend looking into that it's super interesting), just make a way more appealing imagery than knowing that everything you see is basically a video game cutscene. That's why the Hobbit is so dogshit in comparison because relied HEAVILY on cgi",
