As he rose up in the sky, he felt every vibration of every molecule. His super senses made him see the world like never before. His huge brain lets him utilize the powers more optimally than Metroman ever could.\r\n\r\nAs he stood there, sharpening his senses, something struck him. \"What the fuck?\" - Megamind gasped, as he thought he heard a familiar voice through his super-hearing. Focusing his super-eyesight in the direction, he saw a figure resembling Metroman, doing a concert on stage. \"This could not be... unless...\" - Megamind was suspicious at first. But then, he noticed his superhuman fingers hitting the notes on that guitar that no human ever could. There is no doubt now. It was him.  \"METROOOMAAAN!!\" - He screamed as he flew towards him. In a blink of an eye, he punched through and carried him straight, like a raging bullet. Metroman was now pinned against the Moon.\r\n\r\n\"How could you do this to me, leave me all alone?
