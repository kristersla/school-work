You should be roasting the videos that leave it at \"this is a good fragrance, and this is a good fragrance, and this one, too\" -- all while failing to tell us WHY. (Except to say because it was their first fragrance, or because it's cheap.) They should all be telling us why one fragrance is better than the other, whether for the office, gym, clubbing, etc. Any random Tiktokker can make a loop that lists their favorites.
