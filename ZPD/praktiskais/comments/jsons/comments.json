For example in this video the doves flew when the car was approacing closer to it but sometimes when I am on the road they dont fly off even when Im close so I honk at them. If i do this in the exam will it be considered a mistake? Will I be asked why I didnt break harder or caused unnecessary noise which could have been distracting to others?"

First, if you absolutely cannot control your anxiety like I, taking a few deep breaths usually helps in relaxing. Whether that helps or not, I HIGHLY recommend watching YouTube videos of road test recorded using a dashcam or you pay a professional dmv attorney that can walk you through the process of skipping the test drive to get your license. Are you worried of failing, Are you worried of being in the vehicle with a stranger? Combo of both? Something else? paying an attorney to do that work is just the best way to overcome your worries and get your license like I do. \r\n\r\nRemember\r\n\r\n\"Practice makes Perfect.\" \r\n\r\n............and there's nothing to worry about if you did it well on your own!\r\nmments\r\nWilliam Tillman"

So when it came to my 4th test, I watched this and the 'show me, tell me' videos a few hours before my test and I PASSED with NO MINORS. It is about having a positive mind space and truly being safe guys. Don't get put off if you don't pass first time, you'll appreciate it more when you pass later.

My car was on the half of the dual carriageway when I had to go back to the slip road because that idiot was blocking me to join. There was a car behind me,I had to slow down to be able to manage to join the carriageway and thankfully didn't run out of the slip road but just about managed to get on it and thankfully a car behind me joined the carriageway on the second lane. That idiot didnt even flinch. Why can't they not install automatic mandatory video cameras in each car so one can record and send to the police for dangerous driving assault/harassment."

I’m already a driver with 23 year’s experience as someone who’s a army veteran I’ve driven in multiple countries, but I’ve also picked up bad habits. I’ve already passed my theory test and now practicing for the test. Long story short I plan on taking the test in my own car as I’ve been told that I can, and since I’m still legal to drive on my U.S license I plan on driving there on my own. Here’s where I’m confused though, first of do you have to have someone with you in my situation? Im aware of having the mirror and L plates for the test as well as the other things to check. What if i fail? That’s the big question. Legally I’m allowed to drive but I’ve just failed the test. \nSo all of this has raised my concerns and I can’t find a simple straight answer anywhere. \nAppreciate you videos btw , they have been the most useful yet compared to some. I do plan on taking a few hours with a driving instructor for some refresher lessons before the actual test."

I exited the centre the wrong way, as in going against the road markings, but here's the thing, this man sat there and let me drive for the whole 45 minutes and knew the entire time that I'd already failed. Jokes aside, you ask yourself if it's nerves or mere assumption that because nothing Is said that you can just keep going, for me it was a bit of both, and despite appearances I'm not the driving disaster I might sound like. \n\nFor once they gave me a bit of encouragement and told me my driving is good, but just to polish up on signalling and following traffic signs a bit more timely, and I got less points than on my last fail, so it's not entirely an unhappy ending and I'm not giving up. But good luck to anyone with their test in the future, don't assume anything from silence, just do your best, and remember what your instructors have taught you. More importantly, don't be afraid to ask questions, you can do it!!"

Cops here don't even pull people over if they are going 5-10 mph over the limit, and typically will only penalize you if you are going over 10mph above the limit unless there is inclement weather. People will pass on the highway from quickly disappearing merge lanes--they call it a \"suicide lane\" here because so many people trying to show off will pass other merging cars from that lane even when there's barely any road left for them to do it. People are racing each other at damn near every stoplight and while they mostly will stop racing once they hit the speed limit, many times they won't and they'll race each other until the next light, rev their engines up at each other and all that. I bet there is a lot less accidents in Britain because of all the rules you guys have and the much slower speed limits."

        "text": "Hi Richard\nAn informative video with some nice content. There are differences between real life driving and a driving test. However, I personally don't like videos on \"how to pass the test\", as I believe learning to drive safely is far more important. If you learn correctly, you will pass the test, but passing the test doesn't mean you have learnt to drive correctly. The cat B test is the minimum standard required and is the easiest test the DVSA deliver. We should really be aiming for a higher standard than just passing. I know you mention safety several times, but the heading of the video says it all!\nYou mentioned coasting (did you realise you were coasting in neutral in your video at 40.25? Tut tut!!!🤣)\n - for a cat B test, as long as control is not really compromised a learner can coast at any speed and will likely not fail because of it.\nIt is also worth clarifying that you can only go on a motorway with a fully qualified instructor when in a dual controlled car. Trainee instructors are not allowed to take learners on a motorway.\nWhen parking in a bay on a driving test, stopping on the line is still acceptable and correcting will normally receive a driving fault (not a minor). So the pupil may as well leave the car on the line instead of correcting. Why risk making things worse! (Even I’m being test focused now)\nI am interested that you failed for using your indicator on a busy road. If this is not allowed, how on earth can you move off from the side of the road at very busy times?\nThere is nothing wrong with using a “begging signal” if used correctly. I’ve never had anyone fail for this, learners or instructors!\nThank you again for the content and keep it up."

Your videos were very helpful especially tips like how to tell the speed of roads etc. Though for my test I thought I failed 15 minutes in because the Examiner went to break the car. But why I didn't fail is because I also broke at the same time. \n\nWhat happened was I was waiting to come out onto a round-about and saw the car coming out from my 1st exit indicating right. Assuming she was coming off where I was coming from. That she would be my shield for a gap to pull out of. The second the cars stopped to let her by I glanced to see where I was going. Started to move off and then glanced back just to make sure to realize the car was doing a full 360 on the round-about. So I had to break sharply but I noticed the examiner did the same thing. I thought I failed so was completely surprised when he told me I passed. When I asked him about it. He said he assumed the same thing I did and would of done the same thing and while yes he did react but because I reacted myself also and broke at the same time. He let it go. \n\nmy nerves shot through the roof thinking I failed but managed to keep it together enough to pass. I thought to myself that I will keep trying my best cause at least then I will know which areas I still need to work on for the next test. Luckily that never happened"

It does make me question if these types of people have evolved enough to be even classified as human, let alone drive a motor vehicle. What's worse is you get lorries now flashing their lights if you give the two second gap!\n\nRichard, really would like to get your opinion on this, you know when you're in a high traffic motorway section such as rush hour and for some bizarre reason the traffic speeds up to like 40 and then slams on their brakes back to standstill and then quickly back to 40, do you try and average this out / pace the traffic by leaving a good gap infront so you can say go a steady 20 to avoid the stop start / high acceleration and harsh braking? For me this is a much better solution than going up the gears, accelerating hard, wearing you left foot out, wearing the brakes and reducing fuel economy.
