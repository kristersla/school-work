Every one of these people is capable of learning this beat and with each person, there was a chance to give them the experience of learning and realizing they can do something they thought they couldn't. Every time I see someone walk away saying \"I guess I suck at this\" when it's something they could definitely do, it's a little sad to me. They'll probably never try again.",

Go grab some silverware from you kitchen as your drumsticks and keep replaying it in slo-mo over and over again once you have the beat in your head. I recommend starting with the right hand and getting that tempo down first. Then work in the foot. Once you have those two beats down consistently, introduce the left hand because I feel that is the hardest.",

        "text": "I think people who can play drums, even just the basics, take for granted just how much coordination it takes. It's a lot more complicated  than it looks. I've been playing on and off since I was a kid, and I'm mostly self-taught. I have dyspraxia (developmental coordination disorder), and it took me so long to pick it up as my brain couldn't isolate all of the separate parts. Drumming has been great for my coordination, even though it takes me a bit longer than some people to learn beats.",

The first time I ever picked up drum sticks and sat behind drums. I was laying down some funky, Red Hot chili peppers groove. It was just built in. Personally, I think, if after 10 minutes with a set of drums, you should know if you’ve got the ability or not. If you don’t have a built-in groove, it’s an uphill battle, but still doable.",

I took piano, viola, and guitar as a kid but never stuck with it because my parents let me quit for some reason. I really wish I would have stuck with learning an instrument. Playing drums sounds so cool but I wouldn't be able to do that at home with my current living situation, since they're so loud and also need a lot of space. And I bet it costs a lot too since they're so big and so many add-on parts. \n\nThanks for inspiring my musical interests though! Really makes me consider picking up an instrument again.",
